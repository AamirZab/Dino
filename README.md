# Dino
My version of the google Dino Game in Assembly Level C

We implemented the “No internet” dinosaur game using C on the FPGA.
For a quick simulation the code can be run on CPULATOR. 
We use key[0] to start the game. Once it starts the objective of the game is to avoid all the cacti that are placed randomly. 
We can do this by making the dinosaur jump using key[1]. 
If the dinosaur hits an obstacle (the cacti) the game is over. 
he game also get significantly harder after every thousand points the user gets. 
We display the score of the user playing the game on the 7-Segment display. 
To start over we recompile.
